  My academic journey extends beyond the classroom into meaningful research that addresses critical social issues. Through my work in sociology and political science, I'm committed to understanding complex societal challenges and contributing to solutions that promote justice, equity, and human dignity.

  ## Current Research Projects

  ### Genocide Prevention Research
  **Focus**: Historical patterns, prevention strategies, and early warning systems

  I'm involved in research examining how societies can recognize and prevent mass atrocities before they occur. This work involves:
  - Analyzing historical cases to identify common patterns and warning signs
  - Studying international intervention mechanisms and their effectiveness
  - Examining the role of education and civic engagement in prevention
  - Understanding how social and political factors contribute to mass violence

  This research is deeply connected to my passion for civic education. Understanding how genocides occur—and how they can be prevented—informs how I teach history and help students develop critical thinking about contemporary social issues.

  **Status**: Ongoing
  **Institution**: California State University, Fresno

  ### Midwives & Doulas Mapping Project
  **Focus**: Healthcare access, maternal health support, and geographic distribution

  This project contributes to understanding the availability and distribution of maternal health support professionals across different regions. The research involves:
  - Mapping the geographic distribution of certified midwives and doulas
  - Analyzing access patterns and healthcare deserts
  - Examining socioeconomic factors that affect maternal health support availability
  - Understanding barriers to accessing midwifery and doula care

  This work intersects with broader questions of healthcare equity, social support systems, and how geography and economics shape access to critical services during pregnancy and childbirth.

  **Status**: In Progress
  **Institution**: California State University, Fresno

  ## Academic Background

  My research training comes from my coursework and hands-on research experience at:
  - **California State University, Fresno** - Bachelor of Arts in Sociology (In Progress)
  - **Clovis Community College** - Dual Associate in Political Science & Sociology

  Through these programs, I've developed strong research skills including qualitative and quantitative methods, data analysis, literature review, and academic writing.

  ## Why Research Matters for Teaching

  My research experience directly enhances my effectiveness as an educator. It allows me to:
  - Bring current, real-world examples into tutoring sessions
  - Teach students how to think critically and ask important questions
  - Model intellectual curiosity and rigorous thinking
  - Connect classroom learning to meaningful social issues
  - Help students understand the power of research to create change

  ## Future Directions

  As I complete my teaching credential and bachelor's degree, I'm exploring opportunities to:
  - Continue research on genocide prevention and education
  - Publish findings from current research projects
  - Integrate research methodologies into K-12 curriculum
  - Collaborate with other researchers on social justice issues
  - Pursue graduate studies in sociology or education
