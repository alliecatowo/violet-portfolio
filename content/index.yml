        - label: How are sessions conducted?
          content: |
            I offer both in-person and virtual tutoring sessions, depending on your location and preference. Virtual sessions are conducted via Zoom or Google Meet, and I use interactive tools to keep students engaged. Session length is typically 60 minutes, though we can adjust based on the student's age and attention span.

          content: |
            You can reach out via email, phone, or the contact form on my website. We'll start with a brief consultation to discuss your student's needs, goals, and schedule. From there, we can arrange a regular tutoring schedule that works for your family.

    - title: Background & Approach
      questions:
        - label: What is your educational background?
          content: |
            I hold a Dual Associate degree in Political Science and Sociology from Clovis Community College, and I'm currently completing my Bachelor's degree in Sociology and Multiple Subject Teaching Credential at California State University, Fresno. I'm also involved in academic research on genocide prevention and healthcare access.

          content: |
            My teaching combines academic rigor with real-world relevance. Drawing on my background in sociology and political science, I help students understand not just the "what" but the "why" behind what they're learning. I'm particularly passionate about instilling civic values and helping students become informed, engaged citizens.
        - label: Do you assign homework between sessions?
          content: |
            This depends on the student's needs and goals. I can provide supplementary practice materials and activities to reinforce learning between sessions, but I always coordinate with parents to ensure the workload is appropriate and manageable alongside school assignments.
