  Hi, I'm **Violet Gash**, an educator and researcher passionate about creating inclusive, engaging learning experiences that inspire students to think critically about the world around them. I'm currently completing my **Bachelor's degree in Sociology** and **Multiple Subject Teaching Credential** at California State University, Fresno.

  My journey in education is rooted in a deep belief that learning should be accessible, meaningful, and empowering for every student. With a background in political science and sociology from Clovis Community College, I bring both academic rigor and real-world perspective to my teaching.

  ### My Teaching Philosophy

  I believe that **education is about more than memorization** â€“ it's about helping students develop critical thinking skills, understand their place in the world, and become engaged, informed citizens. My approach centers on:

  - **Making connections** between classroom learning and real-world contexts
  - **Inclusive teaching** that adapts to each student's unique learning style and needs
  - **Instilling civic values** and helping students understand their role in society
  - **Building confidence** through supportive, encouraging guidance

  I specialize in working with K-12 students across all subjects, with particular expertise in history, social studies, and civic education. I also have dedicated experience supporting students with developmental disabilities, creating adaptive learning environments where all students can thrive.

  ### Research & Academic Interests

  Beyond tutoring, I'm actively involved in academic research that reflects my commitment to social justice and understanding complex societal issues:

  - **Genocide Prevention Research**: Examining historical patterns and contemporary prevention strategies, with a focus on understanding how societies can recognize and prevent mass atrocities
  - **Midwives & Doulas Mapping Project**: Contributing to research on healthcare access, maternal health support systems, and the geographic distribution of birthing care professionals

  These research experiences inform my teaching, helping me bring depth, nuance, and critical perspectives to discussions of history, society, and current events.

  ### What Drives Me

  What excites me most about education is witnessing the moment when a concept clicks for a student, or when they start to see the connections between what they're learning and the world they live in. I'm particularly passionate about:

  - **History Education**: Bringing historical events to life and helping students understand how the past shapes our present
  - **Civic Engagement**: Empowering young people to understand government, politics, and their rights and responsibilities as citizens
  - **Inclusive Learning**: Ensuring that students with diverse learning needs have access to quality education that respects their strengths and supports their growth

  ### Beyond Teaching

  When I'm not tutoring or conducting research, I enjoy exploring new educational methodologies, staying current on social science research, and thinking about how we can create more equitable education systems. I'm based in the Central Valley of California and am committed to serving my local community through education.
